## Tips

1. **Agencies do the work for you** — Once you're in their system, they'll call you when contracts match
2. **Be responsive** — Contract roles move fast; answer calls/emails quickly
3. **Follow up** — If you don't hear back in a week, send a polite bump
4. **Track everything** — Keep a simple spreadsheet: Company, Contact, Date, Status
5. **Be flexible on rate initially** — You can negotiate up once you have a track record

## Your Rate Expectations

Remote DevOps contract rates typically range:
- Entry/Mid: $50-70/hour
- Senior: $70-90/hour
- Lead/Architect: $90-120+/hour

Since you're willing to start flexible, $55-70/hour is a reasonable starting range that will get you in the door while still being fair for your experience.

Good luck, Tom!
