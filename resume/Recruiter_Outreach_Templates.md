## LinkedIn Message (after connecting)

Hi [Name],

Thanks for connecting. I'm a DevOps Engineer with experience in CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), Kubernetes (GKE and on-prem), and test automation. I've spent the last several years leading DevOps initiatives for an AI development team—building release workflows, migrating branching strategies, and standing up test frameworks.

I'm currently exploring contract opportunities and am open to remote work. Happy to be flexible on rate to find the right fit.

Would you have a few minutes to chat if anything comes across your desk that might be a match?

I've attached my resume for reference.

Thanks,
Tom

## Email to Staffing Agency

Subject: DevOps / Release Engineering Contract Opportunities

Hi,

I'm reaching out to explore contract opportunities in DevOps, release engineering, and test automation.

A quick snapshot of my background:
- CI/CD pipeline design and implementation (GitHub Actions)
- Kubernetes operations (GKE and on-prem environments)
- Test automation architecture (Node.js, Mocha, Chai)
- Recent experience leading technical migrations (GitFlow to GitHub Flow, Vault to Google Secret Manager)

I'm looking for remote contract work and am flexible on rate as I build my contracting experience.

I've attached my resume. I'd welcome a conversation if you have any openings that might be a fit—or to simply get on your radar for future opportunities.

Thanks for your time,

Tom Mackall

## Tips for Outreach

1. **Personalize when possible** — Mention something specific about the recruiter's company or a job they posted

2. **Keep it short** — Recruiters skim. Get to the point fast.

3. **Attach your resume** — Always include it so they don't have to ask

4. **Follow up once** — If no response after a week, a short "Just bumping this up" is fine. Then move on.

5. **Track your outreach** — Keep a simple spreadsheet: Company, Contact, Date, Response
